"""A PyTorch RPC worker target that proves a spawned child ran it.

``marker_worker`` has the signature of ``managers._run_rpc_worker``. It writes the
file named by ``NXMNDR_TEST_RPC_MARKER`` and ends the child there, before the
readiness handshake, so no torch RPC rendezvous is attempted. It lives in an
importable module because a ``spawn`` child unpickles its target by reference.
