"""RpcWorkerManager starts its PyTorch RPC worker under the ``spawn`` start method.

``spawn`` pickles the process target, so a nested function fails in the parent with
"Can't pickle local object". The manager always uses the ``spawn`` context: the
child must not inherit the server's gRPC and torch threads, as ``fork`` would do.
The worker's arguments are plain values (no model spec: models are loaded later by
model ID). The full start, with the real rendezvous, runs in
tst/integration/test_rpc_pytorch_service.py.
