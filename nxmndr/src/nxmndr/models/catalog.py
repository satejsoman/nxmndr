"""The PyTorch model catalog: torchvision and torchgeo model classes served by name.

A catalog name is ``<family>:<name>``: ``torchvision:<name>`` for a name that
``torchvision.models.list_models()`` returns and ``torchgeo:<name>`` for one that
``torchgeo.models.list_models()`` returns. A ``ModelSpec`` with format ``PYTORCH``
and a catalog name as ``model_class`` is built by :func:`build` in the PyTorch RPC
worker. Names registered with ``register_pytorch_model`` are resolved before the
catalog and keep their own path.

Served names (:func:`list_model_classes`, the server's Capabilities entry
``pytorch_model_classes``) are the names this module builds and runs on one image
chip. ``tst/integration/test_model_catalog_service.py`` loads and runs every one of
them through the gRPC service and the RPC worker.

- torchvision: the image classification models
  (``list_models(module=torchvision.models)``) and the semantic segmentation models
  (``list_models(module=torchvision.models.segmentation)``). The detection, video,
  optical-flow and quantization builders are not served (:data:`TORCHVISION_EXCLUDED`).
- torchgeo: the names in :data:`TORCHGEO_SERVED`. Every other name of torchgeo 0.10.1
  is in :data:`TORCHGEO_EXCLUDED` with the reason.

A family whose package cannot be imported gives no names. The list is ordered by
family, then name.

Construction (:func:`build`): the family's ``get_model(name, weights=None, ...)``, so
no pretrained weights are downloaded (torchvision segmentation builders also get
``weights_backbone=None``). The constructor arguments are:

1. ``num_classes`` and ``in_channels`` from ``ModelSpec.metadata``, when present;
2. else inferred from the weights file: the class count is the first dimension of
   the class-head weights and the band count is the second dimension of the stem
   weights. The two entries are found by building the model on the ``meta`` device
   with marker values of the two arguments (the entries whose dimension takes the
   marker), so no per-model key list is kept;
3. else the family's defaults.

torchvision segmentation builders get ``aux_loss=True`` when the weights file has
``aux_classifier.*`` entries. The weights load with ``strict=True``. A file that
does not match is a :class:`CatalogError` that names the class, its arguments, the
first differing entry and the count of all. Every ``CatalogError`` message is one line.

Input and output: the built model is a :class:`CatalogModel`. It takes the chip as
the server sends it (``[H, W, C]`` float32, no scaling or normalization; CONTRACTS.md
2.4) as one image ``[1, C, H, W]`` and returns one tensor (the ``out`` entry of a
torchvision segmentation model). ``nxmndr.server.dispatch.catalog_output`` turns that
tensor into a result family.

Fixed input sizes (:func:`input_size`, :func:`list_input_sizes`; the server's
Capabilities entry ``pytorch_model_input_sizes``): some served models take one square
chip size only. The size is read from the model's own metadata on a build with the
family's default arguments on the ``meta`` device: ``image_size`` (torchvision
``VisionTransformer``, torchgeo ``EarthLoc``) or timm's strict ``patch_embed.img_size``
(torchgeo's timm ViTs, DINOv2 ViTs and ScaleMAE). A torchvision builder whose model
class takes no input-size argument is not built for this. A model that requires a
size without recording it is in :data:`INPUT_SIZES_NOT_ON_THE_MODEL`. The server
refuses a chip of another size for such a model before it reaches the model
(``nxmndr.server.dispatch.check_catalog_chip``).
