## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/nxmndr/issues) before creating a new one.
- Use a clear, descriptive title and include steps to reproduce the problem.

### Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Install the development environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n nxmndr python=3.11 -y
   conda activate nxmndr
   cd nxmndr/
   pip install -e .[server,dev]
   ```
3. Make your changes and add tests where appropriate.
4. Ensure all checks pass:
   ```bash
   make lint
   make test
   ```
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of the changes.

### Code Style

- This project uses [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting (line length: 100).
- Type hints are checked with [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/).
- Run `make format` to auto-format your code before committing.

### Testing

- **Unit tests** (`make test-unit`): No external services or GPU required.
- **Integration tests** (`make test-integration`): Spin up ephemeral gRPC servers.
- **Coverage** (`make coverage`): Generate a coverage report.
